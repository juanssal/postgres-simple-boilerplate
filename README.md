# postgres-simple-boilerplate
Simple inventory management app.

## Description

The idea is to have an inventory (list of items) with:
- a simple handle to add or substract quantities for each
- an option to delete an item
- an option to create an item
- a submit button that will save the state of the inventory at a given date
- an option to go back in time to see inventory at other times

## Postgres setup
